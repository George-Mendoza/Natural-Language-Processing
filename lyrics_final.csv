"19049"	"Last Call"	21	"So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\""	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19050"	"Last Call"	21	"And I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know."	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19051"	"Last Call"	21	" So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like poppin' off the way it should have been. "	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19052"	"Last Call"	21	"One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to..."	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19053"	"Last Call"	21	"...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up..."	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"

"19055"	"Last Call"	21	" You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. "	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19056"	"Last Call"	21	"I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\""	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19057"	"Last Call"	21	"And Beans was still working on his album at that time"	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19058"	"Last Call"	21	"so I came up there to Baseline,"	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19059"	"Last Call"	21	" it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. "	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19060"	"Last Call"	21	"And Hiphop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And"	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19061"	"Last Call"	21	"really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX"	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19062"	"Last Call"	21	"And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.'"	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19063"	"Last Call"	21	"Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\""	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19064"	"Last Call"	21	"\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?"	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"

"19066"	"Last Call"	21	"You know I ain't talkin shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. "	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19067"	"Last Call"	21	"I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, "	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19068"	"Last Call"	21	"The Streets is Watching"	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19069"	"Last Call"	21	", I'm lookin, these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know."	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19070"	"Last Call"	21	" So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" "	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19071"	"Last Call"	21	"And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said \"man that was tight.\""	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19072"	"Last Call"	21	"That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. "	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19073"	"Last Call"	21	"So, "	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"

"19076"	"Last Call"	21	" And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. "	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19077"	"Last Call"	21	"My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that."	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19078"	"Last Call"	21	"And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&amp;R's"	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19079"	"Last Call"	21	", and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. "	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19080"	"Last Call"	21	"So I'll play them these post-"	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19081"	"Last Call"	21	"Blueprint"	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"

"19083"	"Last Call"	21	"Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me."	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19084"	"Last Call"	21	"You know what happened, it was some A&amp;R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say \"naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me,"	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"

"19090"	"Last Call"	21	"Dame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\""	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19091"	"Last Call"	21	"Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. "	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19092"	"Last Call"	21	"So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'"	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"

"19096"	"Last Call"	21	"Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him"	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19097"	"Last Call"	21	"and he's like \"oh shit\""	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19098"	"Last Call"	21	"\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\""	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19099"	"Last Call"	21	"Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know"	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19100"	"Last Call"	21	"So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\""	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"

"19102"	"Last Call"	21	" I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. "	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19103"	"Last Call"	21	"Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer rapper,\""	"The College Dropout"	"Kanye West"
"19104"	"Last Call"	21	" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do.
